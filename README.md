# Candidate Assessment: Spec-Driven Development With Codegen Tools

This assessment evaluates how you use modern code generation tools (for example `5.2-Codex`, `Claude`, `Copilot`, and similar) to design, build, and test a software application using a spec-driven development pattern. You may build a frontend, a backend, or both.

## Goals
- Build a working application with at least one meaningful feature.
- Create a testing framework to validate the application.
- Demonstrate effective use of code generation tools to accelerate delivery.
- Show clear, maintainable engineering practices.

## Deliverables
- Application source code in this repository.
- A test suite and test harness that can be run locally.
- Documentation that explains how to run the app and the tests.

## Scope Options
Pick one:
- Frontend-only application.
- Backend-only application.
- Full-stack application.

Your solution should include at least one real workflow, for example:
- Create and view a resource.
- Search or filter data.
- Persist data in memory or storage.

## Rules
- You must use a code generation tool (for example `5.2-Codex`, `Claude`, or similar). You can use multiple tools.
- You must build the application and a testing framework for it.
- The application and tests must run locally.
- Do not include secrets or credentials in this repository.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Working product: Does the app do what it claims?
- Test coverage: Do tests cover key workflows and edge cases?
- Engineering quality: Clarity, structure, and maintainability.
- Use of codegen: How effectively you used tools to accelerate work.
- Documentation: Clear setup and run instructions.

## What to Submit
- When you are complete, put up a Pull Request against this repository with your changes.
- A short summary of your approach and tools used in your PR submission
- Any additional information or approach that helped you.

# Task Manager API

A simple backend application built using a spec-driven development approach.
The API supports creating, listing (with filtering and search), updating, and deleting tasks, with data persisted locally using SQLite.

The project demonstrates:

Clear API specification (SPEC.md)

Clean FastAPI + SQLAlchemy architecture

Automated test coverage with pytest

Local development and execution
## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11
- FastAPI
- SQLite
- SQLAlchemy
- Pytest

## Run the application
```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
